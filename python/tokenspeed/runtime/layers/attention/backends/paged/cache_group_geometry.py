"""Cache-group geometry learned from the pool's published specs.

One immutable value object answers every "what shape is this group?"
question a backend asks — group block granularities, every group's family
(the positive-claim vocabulary ``cache_consumer_families`` filters against),
and which group is the full history the draft chain writes along. Learned
exactly once, at ``set_cache_pool`` (the arena's published specs are the
only source, so the eager and CUDA-graph arms can never answer
differently).

    Attributes:
        granularities: ``group_id -> block_granularity`` for every non-state
            group (rows-per-page span; equals the group's page size for the
            row-geometry groups kept here).
        families: ``group_id -> family`` for every published group. The
            positive-claim vocabulary: a backend keeps exactly the delivered
            groups whose family it declared in ``cache_consumer_families``;
            the rest (state blocks for the mamba backend, wrapper-owned conv
            groups) ride the same dict to their own consumers. Empty when
            no pool is bound (unit fixtures, pre-contract draft pools).
        full_history_group_id: The first ``family="history"`` group with
            ``retention="full_history"`` — the table the router's draft
            write locations ride — or None when the pool publishes no such
            group (a single-group pool's sole group then serves as the
            history).
        row_geometry: ``group_id -> (rows_per_page, entry_stride_tokens)``
            for every non-state group: the physical row layout the leaves'
            kernels read, so a rebind keeps it.
        retentions: ``group_id -> retention`` for every non-state group; the
            fact ``full_history_group_id`` is chosen from.
