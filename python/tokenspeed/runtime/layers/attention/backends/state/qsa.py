"""QSA speculative side-state lifecycle.

QSA projections and cache algorithms live in ``attention.qsa.indexer`` because
they are model-owned modules. This backend owns the execution-side boundary:
target verification stages candidates during forward, then commits only the
accepted prefix after speculative sampling has produced per-request lengths.
