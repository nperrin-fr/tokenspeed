"""sonic-sampler entry points for the runtime's ``sonic`` sampling backend.

sonic-sampler (optional dependency) supplies everything. It binds ``triton``
at import time, so it is imported under the ``tokenspeed_triton`` redirect:
every kernel in the chain compiles with the one vendored Triton.

``available`` is False when sonic-sampler is not installed; every other name
is then None. An installed sonic-sampler without in-kernel noise fails this
import loudly.
